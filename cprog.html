  <h1 style="color:blueviolet; text-align:center;"><u>C PROGRAMMING PAGE</u></h1>
    <ul>
  <li> <p> Structured. It offers a structured programming approach for breaking down problems into smaller modules or functions that are easy to understand and modify.
Portable. C is machine-independent and C programs can be executed on different machines.
Mid-level programming language. It's a mid-level language that supports the features of both a low-level and a high-level language.
Rich library. It offers numerous built-in library functions that expedite the development process.
Dynamic memory allocation. C supports the dynamic memory allocation feature, which can be used to free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.
Speed. It's a compiler-based language, which makes the compilation and execution of code faster. Since only essential and required features are included in C, it saves processing power and improves speed.
Pointers. C uses pointers, which improve performance by enabling direct interaction with the system memory.
Recursion. C enables developers to backtrack by providing code reusability for every function.
Extensible. A C program can be easily extended. If code is already written, new features and functionalities can be added to it with minor alterations.
C also comes with a few shortfalls, even though it's an ideal language for programming beginners due to its simple syntax, algorithms and modular structure. The following are a few disadvantages of using C:</p></li>

 <li><p>OOP features. C doesn't extend its support for object-oriented programming (OOP) features, which enables the creation of subclasses from parent classes. Unlike Java, Python or C++, multiple inheritances can't be created in C, which makes it difficult to reuse existing code.
Namespace feature. C lacks namespace features, which means the same variable name can't be reused in one scope. Without namespaces, it's impossible to declare two variables with the same name.
Run-time checking. C doesn't display code errors after each line of code; instead, all the errors are presented by the compiler after the program has been written. This can make code checking a challenge, especially for larger programs.
Exception handling. C lacks exception handling, which is the ability to handle exceptions, such as bugs and anomalies that can happen during source code
Constructor and destructor. Since C isn't object oriented, it doesn't offer constructor and destructor features. Constructing or destructing a variable in C must be done manually through a function or by other means.
Garbage collection. C isn't equipped with garbage collection. This important feature automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer required by the library or an app.
Where is C used?</p></li>
<li>
<p>
C has a wide range of real-world applications that aren't limited to the development of OSes and applications. C is also used in areas such as graphical user interface development and integrated development environments</p>

The following are some use cases for the C <br></li>
<li>

<p>OSes, such as Unix and all Unix applications;
databases, including Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL, which are partially written in C;
language compilers, including the C compiler;
text editors;
print spoolers;
assemblers;
network drivers;
modern programs, such as Git and FreeBSD;
language interpreters; and
utilities, such as network drivers, mouse drivers and keyboard drivers.
programming languages and frameworks
There are a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including C.
What's the difference between C and C++?
While C and C++ sound familiar, the usage and features of both languages differ to a certain extent. C++ is a superset and successor to the C language that uses an entirely different set of programming concepts. C is a procedural programming language, whereas C++ provides OOP support.</p></li>

The following highlights the differences between the two languages:<li>
<p>
C is a procedural language that provides no support for objects and classes. C++ is a combination of OOP and procedural programming languages.
C has 32 keywords and C++ has 63 keywords.
C supports built-in data types, while C++ supports both built-in and user-defined data types.
C doesn't have access modifiers, whereas C++ does.
C uses the <stdio.h> header file for input and output operations and C++ uses the <iostream.h> header file for input and output operations.
C can't hide data, while C++ is secure and provides encryption.
There's no direct exception handling support in C, but C++ supports it.
C doesn't support function and operator overloading, but C++ does.
In C, the main() function calls are made through other functions used in the code, but C++ doesn't provide that functionality.
Reference variables aren't supported by C, but C++ supports them.</p></li></ul>
