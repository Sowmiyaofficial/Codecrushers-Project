  <h1>What is HTML?</h1><br>
    <h3>*HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
    *HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<br>
    *HTML describes the structure of a Web page.<br>
    *HTML consists of a series of elements.<br>
    *HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.<br>
    *HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.<br></h3><br>

   <h2> Example Explained</h2><br>
   <ul><h3>
<li>*The !DOCTYPE html declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.</li>
<li>*The html element is the root element of an HTML page.</li>
<li>*The head  element contains meta information about the HTML page.</li>
<li>*The title element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).</li>
<li>*The body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
<li>*The h1 element defines a large heading</li>
<li>*The p element defines a paragraph.</li></h3><br>

<h2>HTML tables</h2><br>
<h3>A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.</h3><br>
<h2>
    Table Heading</h2><br>
<h3>Table heading can be defined using "th" tag. This tag will be put to replace "td" tag, which is used to represent actual data cell. Normally you will put your top row as table heading as shown below, otherwise you can use "th" element in any row. Headings, which are defined in "th" tag are centered and bold by default.</h3><br>
<h2>Tables Backgrounds</h2><br>
<h3>You can set table background using one of the following two ways −</h3>

<h3>bgcolor attribute − You can set background color for whole table or just for one cell.</h3>

<h3>background attribute − You can set background image for whole table or just for one cell.</h3>
